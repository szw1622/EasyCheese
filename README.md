## Project Intention
Easy Cheese is an interactive, visual drag-and-drop programming game developed using the Qt Creator platform and C++. The core objective of this initiative is to introduce K-12 students to fundamental programming language concepts, fostering a passion for coding from an early age.

The inspiration for Easy Cheese stems from my own initial challenges in learning programming. I believe that a more engaging learning experience could have significantly accelerated my skill development. With this project, I aim to provide a user-friendly introduction to programming, making it accessible and enjoyable for those aspiring to pursue careers in coding. The game incorporates essential programming logic, including “if” and “while” statements. Dynamic visual elements, such as flashing blocks, provide players with a tangible understanding of the program's execution process.

Choosing Qt Creator for development, instead of relying on a pre-built game engine, was a deliberate decision to refine my programming skills and prepare for a broader spectrum of challenges. This choice has not only honed my proficiency in using Qt Creator but has also deepened my understanding and mastery of the Model-View concept by delving into lower-level logic.

## Interactions:
1.It is strongly recommended to start playing from the first level.
2.In the bottom right corner, basic game controls are explained.
3.The goal of the game is to build programs to make the robot eat cheese.
4.You can adjust the speed of the animation; moving the speed slider down speeds up the animation, while moving it up slows it down.
5.The arrow on the robot's belly indicates its direction.

## How to Pass Levels:
If you're unable to pass a level, you can refer to the solutions.
To avoid spoilers and preserve the experience, some solutions are shown on the next page.

Level 1: Begin - Move Forward - Move Forward - Move Forward - Eat Cheese, Run Program!

Level 2: Begin - Move Forward - Turn Right - Move Forward - Turn Left - Move Forward - Move Forward - Turn Left - Move Forward - Eat Cheese, Run Program!

Level 3: Begin - Move Forward - Move Forward - Move Forward - Turn Right Begin - Move Forward - Move Forward - Eat Cheese, Run Program!

Level 4: Begin - While Not Facing Wall - Move Forward - If Facing Wall - Turn Right - End If - End While - Eat Cheese, Run Program!

Continue to use your skills and complete the upcoming levels!
